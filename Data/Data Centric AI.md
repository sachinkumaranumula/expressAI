# Data Centric AI
> Notes from talk by Snorkel AI on their approach to Enterprise AI

## Success Factors
- **Successful** enterprises will build upon foundation models in a GPT-X fashion
- Future of enterprise AI is **specialized** or hybrid AI
- Most production-ready solutions will be done on **fine-tuned** models
- Graphing _Data Complexity/Accuracy Requirement_ from simple/prototype to complex/production is where enterprises would like to be at, the upper right
- Tweaking parameters is not the _programming interface_ but _data_ is and hence the needed for iteratively labeling and developing data
- **Data Development** = Labeling, Cleaning, Slicing, Sampling, Filtering, Augmenting
- **Stack** = Infra > LLMs > Data Development > Applications

## UseCases
